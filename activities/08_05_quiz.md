## Code output

Work with a partner to predict the output of the following code blocks. When
you think you have it, enter the code in a python shell to see if you were
right. If you were wrong, make sure you understand why.

1. `print()`

    ```python
    >>> a = 5
    >>> b = 6
    >>> print(a, b)
    ```

1. rules of precedence

    ```python
    >>> x = 4
    >>> print(x + x ** 2 / x - x)
    ```

1. `type()`

    ```python
    >>> print(type(42))
    >>> print(type(42.0))
    ```

1. Look out!

    ```python
    >>> y = 4
    >>> y-1 = 5
    >>> print(y + y-1)
    ```

1. It's not you, it's me.

    ```python
    >>> j = 'Terminator'
    >>> k = 2
    >>> print(j + k) 
    ```
