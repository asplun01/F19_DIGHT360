1. Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour to compute gross pay.

```
Enter Hours: 35
Enter Rate: 2.75
Pay: 96.25
```

to properly round the resulting pay to two decimal places.


1. Write a program which prompts the user for a Celsius temperature, convert the temperature to Fahrenheit, and print out the converted temperature. (*HINT* ![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?(C%20\cdot%20\frac{9}{5})%20+%2032%20=%20F))
